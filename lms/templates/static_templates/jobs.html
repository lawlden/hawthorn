        Are you an expert in one (or more) facets of Data Privacy or Information Security? If you're a student with Enstructo, odds are you're qualified to become an Enstructor. Enstructors earn money and CPE credits creating the courses you see on this site.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We are committed to a simple, fixed revenue model. Courses cost $50 per credit hour and our Enstructors receive 50% of all revenue generated by their courses. No forced flash sales, no variable earnings. Enstructors can also rest easy, knowing they retain <strong>all</strong> rights to their course content.<br/>
